During this period, Zadar flourished as an important commercial and cultural center, with architecture and art strongly influenced by Venice.</p>
                <p id="p-gray">After the decline of the Republic of Venice in 1797, the city was integrated into the Austro-Hungarian Empire but was ceded to Italy by the Treaty of Rapallo in 1920. During World War II, Zadar was severely damaged, and after the war, it was integrated into Yugoslavia, eventually becoming part of independent Croatia in 1991.</p>

                    <p id="p">This was our second trip to Croatia, but this time we were accompanied by my mother, Sidia, on her first trip to Europe.</p>
                    <p class="special-cote" id="text-destak">Actually, she had arrived about three hours ago, and we were already heading on the trip to Zadar.</p>
                    <p id="p">Between buses, trains, and a plane, we arrived in Zadar at 8:25 in the morning. We planned to take a local bus upon arrival but ended up taking a somewhat suspicious transport from the airport. It was a private van that called for people who were going to take the bus.</p>
                    <p id="p">Fortunately, everything went well, and we arrived at our hotel, Apartments Jadera, without any issues.</p>
                    <p id="p">After having a meal at the hotel, we set off for the island of Preko using a ferry. On the island, we explored the:</p>

                    <p class="special-cote" id="text-destak">My mother even received flowers from one of the island's residents. The old gentleman was very sweet. 🌸🌼🌺</p>
                    <p id="p">At the end of the day, we settled among the rocks and sand on the shore, where we rested our feet in the icy waters while enjoying the stunning view of Otok Galevac Island.</p>

                    <p id="p">Today was the day to explore the city of Zadar.</p>
                    <p id="p">We started with the Morske orgulje (Sea Organ), a unique architectural installation that produces music naturally with the movement of the waves.</p>
                    <p class="special-cote" id="text-destak">The music created by the waves on this structure is simply incredible. It's a symphony. 🎶🎵</p>
                    <p id="p">After appreciating the view and the sound, we strolled through the Historic Center (Povijesni centar Zadra) and visited several churches: the Church of St. Donatus (Crkva sv. Donata), the Cathedral of St. Anastasia (Katedrala sv. Stošije), the Church of St. Simeon (Crkva sv. Šime), the Church of St. Mary (Crkva sv. Marije), and the Church of St. Francis (Crkva sv. Frane). Unfortunately, they were all closed, frustrating my mother's plans to visit a church on her first trip to Europe.</p>
                    <p id="p">After that, we explored other magnificent points of Zadar:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li id="list">Walked along the Riva (Šetnja Rivaom);</li>
                        <li id="list">Saw the Zadar Walls (Zidina Zadra);</li>
                        <li id="list">Visited Queen Jelena Madijevka Park;</li>
                        <li id="list">People's Square (Narodni trg);</li>
                        <li id="list">and the famous Široka ul. street, known as Kalelarga.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p id="p">We ended the day at the Five Wells Square (Trg Pet Bunara), where the Land Gate and Captain's Tower are located.</p>
                    <p class="special-cote" id="text-destak">We walked more than 13 kilometers. 🚶‍♀️🚶🏽🚶‍♀️🚶‍♂️</p>
                    <p id="p">And to finish the day we had dinner and went to Pozdrav suncu (Greeting to the Sun), an interactive art project next to the Sea Organ consisting of solar panels that light up at night, creating a stunning light show.</p>

                    <p id="p">Unfortunately, it was time to return home.</p>
                    <p id="p">We took the bus to the airport at 4:05 in the morning. After a few hours of waiting, our flight left at 9:05, and we returned to Berlin, carrying many unforgettable memories.</p>
                    <p id="p">We hope this little account inspires others to explore Zadar with the same joy and adventure we had!</p>
                    <p class="special-cote" id="text-destak">Until the next trip! 🌍✈️❤️</p>
